Here's how it'll work.\n","\n","**Step 1**: Pick an activity or behavior that you do regularly. This might include watching TV, laughing, doing your homework, listening to music, spending time on social media, saying \"thank you\" to your parents, cleaning your room, or anything else that you do.\n","\n","**Step 2**: **Ask a question** about that activity or behavior! For example, if you laugh a lot, you could ask, \"What are the kinds of things that make me laugh the most?\" If you watch a lot of TV, you might ask, \"What kinds of TV shows do I spend the most time watching?\"\n","\n","**Step 3**: Figure out how to record or collect your data for the next **4-5 days**! This doesn't need to be fancy. We're going to talk more about collecting data next week. For now, you just need to think about how you'll track the information. Make sure to keep it all in one place and try to collect the same kind of information every time. Using the laughing example from Step 2, you might decide that every time you laugh, you'll right down the the specific thing that made you laugh (a TV show? a friend? a pet?) and where you were at the time.\n","\n","**Step 4**: This is the fun part!! After you collect your data, turn them into a visual! Don't worry, you don't need to be an artist and your visual doesn't need to be a work of art. It's perfectly okay for you to hand-draw it. The main focus here is telling a story with the data that you collected - there is no right or wrong answer because you are telling the story the way you want to!
