        "Hurrah! \\ (•◡•) / We have arrived at the last, but not the least, week of our bootcamp. We have learned so much together: from getting a first taste of data science to data modelling. Without your dedication and hard work, it would not have been possible. \n",

        "Last week, we learned how to use Google Data Studio to do data modelling through a mini-project. This week, we will reach the heights of our journey: **Machine Learning** (ML) models. **Machine learning** can teach computers how to make decisions and predictions, by giving them the ability to learn from data. For example, in week 5's lesson, we use **machine learning** to teach computers to **generage new skin stones**, by using existing **skin stone data**.\n",

        "**Machine Learning models** have been applied in many areas that we are interested in such as **healthcare**, **climate change**, **education**, etc. Using machine learning models, you **make change**, **get creative**, **solve problems**, and MORE.\n",
